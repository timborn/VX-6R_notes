== Overview

Notes made by a ham newbie regarding Yaesu VX-6R radio, as he muddled his way through the learning curve.

== Tuning To A Frequency

. Pick a band using image:images/BAND.png["BAND button", 45] button

=== ... using the dial

. use the dial to get close
. if you press the image:images/F-W.png["F/W button", 45] momentarily, then rotate the ''DIAL'', frequency steps of 1 MHz will be selected.  Useful for moving quickly.  Toggle the 1 MHz steps by hitting the image:images/F-W.png["F/W button", 45] button again.
. if you are having trouble, make sure you are in VFO mode image:images/V-M.png["V/M button", 45].

=== ... direct keypad entry

. leading zeros may be required - type in all (6?) digits
. no key needed to indicate completion; it is expecting exactly 6 digits

== Scanning

=== Band Scanning

. Pick a band using image:images/BAND.png["BAND button", 45] button
. long-press image:images/BAND.png["BAND button", 45]  button to start scanning (SCN)
. press *PTT* to stop scanning (this will not xmit)
