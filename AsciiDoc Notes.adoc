= Images

== Inline Images
There are two AsciiDoc image macro types, block and inline. As with all macros, the block and inline forms differ by the number of colons that follow the macro name. The block form uses two colons (::), whereas the inline form only uses one (:).

inline an image like this: image:images/BAND.png[]

== Image Properties

image::images/BAND.png["alt text", 34, 27.5]
